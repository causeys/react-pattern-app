                <p>My name is Sophia C. and I created this web application in order to learn some new things and combine two of my biggest passions: coding and fiber arts. I am in the process of drafting knit and crochet patterns that will be available for purchase and this web app will be used in conjunction with those patterns.</p>
                <p>I earned my B.S. in Human Development at Cornell University and then decided to pursue coding. I recently earned my master's in computer science at Kent State University. When I'm not coding or doing yarnie things I am either baking, reading, or watching French reality tv shows.</p>
